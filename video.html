    <h1>The Colors</h1>
    <p>How do you know the colors are clasificated?</p>
    <section>
        <h2>Primary Colors</h2>
        <p>These colors are the fundamental building blocks of all other colors. You can't create them by mixing other colors. They're like
        the original three musketeers of the color wheel.</p>

        <h2>Secondary colors</h2>
        <p>These colors are what you get when you mix two primary colors together in equal parts. Think of them as the direct offspring of
        the primaries.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Tertiary Colors</h2>
        <p>These colors are created by mixing a primary color with an adjacent secondary color. These colors often have a two-word name,
        combining the names of the primary and secondary colors used, with the primary color always listed first.</p>
